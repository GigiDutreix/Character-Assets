# CaseFlow Tracker

A simple web application built with Python (Flask) designed for solo legal practitioners or small firms to track basic case information and deadlines, intended as a replacement for manual spreadsheet tracking.

**Domain:** Legal Tech / Practice Management

## Features

*   **CRUD Operations:** Add, view, edit, and delete legal cases.
*   **Core Case Data:** Tracks Case Number, Case Name, Client Name, Deadline, Status, and Notes.
*   **Status Management:** Uses a predefined list of common case statuses.
*   **Deadline Tracking:** Includes a date field for case deadlines.
*   **CSV Import/Export:** Allows bulk import and export of case data via CSV files.
*   **Simple Interface:** Basic HTML interface for easy interaction.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python 3, Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML, Basic CSS (no complex JS framework)
*   **Data Storage:** **In-Memory List (WARNING: Data is lost on application restart. Suitable for demonstration only.)**

## Running the Application

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.6+ installed.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer).

2.  **Clone the Repository (or download files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd CaseFlowTracker
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask Development Server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    (Alternatively: `python app.py`)

6.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the address provided by Flask).

## CSV Import Format

When importing, the CSV file should have the following headers:

*   `case_number`
*   `case_name`
*   `client_name`
*   `deadline` (Format: YYYY-MM-DD, leave empty if no deadline)
*   `status` (Must be one of the predefined statuses: Open, Pending, Discovery, etc.)
*   `notes`

**Note:** The `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns are generated by the application during export. Any `id` column present during import will be ignored, and new sequential IDs will be assigned to imported cases.

## Important Limitations

*   **In-Memory Storage:** This demonstration uses a simple Python list to store case data. **All data will be lost when the application is stopped or restarted.** For any real-world use, this **must** be replaced with a persistent database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   **Basic Validation:** Input validation is minimal. More robust checks (e.g., ensuring unique case numbers, more detailed date validation) would be needed for production.
*   **No User Authentication:** There is no login system; anyone with access can view and modify data.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for single-user or very small-scale use due to in-memory storage and simple architecture.

This project serves as a basic demonstration of building a CRUD web application with Python/Flask and handling simple data import/export, tailored to a legal context.
